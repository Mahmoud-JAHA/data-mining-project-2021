# data-mining-project-2021
My complete work on the Data Mining Project 2021 (Report+R code)

This is a personal work on a university project, it undoubtedly contains some errors so be aware when reading or analysing my code. 
I lost the initial database so I didn't change the path to get the data frame at the begining of the R code. Unless I find it again in the future, 
it is impossible to test the code with the initial data, sorry for the inconvenience.

Hope you'll enjoy reading my project as much as I enjoyed writting it =) !
